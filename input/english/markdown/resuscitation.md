\### resuscitation

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resuscitation)

- an act or process of resuscitating someone or something:
- the act or an instance of reviving someone from apparent death or from unconsciousness, — see also cardiopulmonary resuscitation
    - The EMS response times were generally fast in both groups, but successful prehospital resuscitations were not associated with significantly shorter response times than those reported in cases of refractory cardiac arrest.
    - — Arthur L. Kellermann et al.
    - … resuscitation techniques differ from other procedures in medicine in that they are usually performed only in critical situations, and thus the opportunities to learn and practice them are inherently limited.
    - — Jeffrey P. Burns et al.
- the act or an instance of restoring someone or something to an active or flourishing state
    - Punk may not be dead, but it certainly could use some resuscitation. And that's where Anthrax comes in.
    - — Craig Tomashoff
    - His resuscitation is evident in the 1982 reissue of his autobiography, "An Artist in America."
    - — Grace Glueck
