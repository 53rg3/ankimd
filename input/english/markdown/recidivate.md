\### recidivate

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recidivate)

- to relapse into a previous condition or mode of behavior and especially delinquency or criminal activity : to exhibit recidivism
    - There are three things that exponentially decrease the likelihood that an offender will recidivate. Offenders who obtain a diploma or GED certificate, obtain a job skill and maintain gainful employment are far more likely to break out of this dreaded cycle.
    - — Christopher Bowman
