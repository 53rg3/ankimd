[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abutment)

- the place at which one thing borders on or abuts another
    - Once it chanced that I stood in the very abutment of a rainbow's arch, which filled the lower stratum of the atmosphere, tinging the grass and leaves around, and dazzling me as if I looked through colored crystal.
    - — Henry David Thoreau
- the part of a structure (such as an arch or a bridge) that directly receives thrust or pressure
- a tooth or part of a dental implant to which a prosthetic appliance (such as a bridge or artificial crown) is attached for support
    - A dental bridge, like a highway bridge … is supported by abutments, sound teeth on either side of the empty gap.
    - — Mount Sinai Medical Center Family Guide to Dental Health
