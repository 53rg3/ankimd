\### deviant

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deviant)

- straying or deviating especially from an accepted norm (see norm sense 2)
    - deviant behavior
- someone or something that deviates from a norm, a person who differs markedly (as in social adjustment or behavior) from what is considered normal or acceptable
    - social/moral/sexual deviants
    - Those who commit crimes also watch TV, go to the grocery store, and have their hair cut. Thus, while our stereotypes may suggest that there is a wide gulf between deviants and conventional people …, the behavior of deviants is often very conventional.
    - — Paul C. Higgins and Richard R. Butler
    - The theory thus centers on the question: What are the processes through which people are assigned a social identity as deviants by others and enter upon ongoing careers as deviants?
    - — Mary Beth Norton et al.
    - Acts of punishment thus designate who is in our community by clearly defining who is not in our community. Social solidarity is purchased through the punishment of deviants.
    - — Mark Colvin
