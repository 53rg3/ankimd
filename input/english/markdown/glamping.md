\### glamping

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glamping)

- outdoor camping with amenities and comforts (such as beds, electricity, and access to indoor plumbing) not usually used when camping
    - If the eco-friendly idea of falling asleep under the stars and roasting marshmallows around a campfire appeals to you, but the reality of pitching a tent and sleeping on bumpy ground does not, glamping, the new term being used for upscale—or glamorous—camping, could be your ideal green vacation.
    - — Jennifer Conlin
    - Are there proper hot showers or am I going to die of cold? Because I was never that sure about glamping in the first place; it was Gavin's idea.
    - — Sophie Kinsella
